# LemonTreePi 
=============

A simple monitoring system for your potted plants and windowsill gardens that will track & record: 

* Soil Moisture Levels
* Air Temperature
* Received Sunlight


This system uses [RaspberryPi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/), the Pimoroni [Enviro pHat] (https://learn.pimoroni.com/tutorial/sandyj/getting-started-with-enviro-phat), and SparkFun's [Soil Moisture Sensor] (https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/soil-moisture-sensor-hookup-guide).
