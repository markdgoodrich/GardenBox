# LemonTreePi 
=============

A simple monitoring system for potted plants that uses RaspberryPi, the Pimoroni [Enviro pHat] (https://learn.pimoroni.com/tutorial/sandyj/getting-started-with-enviro-phat), and SparkFun [Soil Moisture Sensor] (https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/soil-moisture-sensor-hookup-guide)


----------------------

All data collected is automatically written and copied in a format that is compatible with the Mac OS X [Grapher](http://www.fusionmath.com/apple) application, making visual data easily availible.

To ensure quick and non-interupted data transfer, make sure to authenticate a [key](http://support.modwest.com/content/20/90/en/how-do-i-get-ssh-to-authenticate-me-via-publicprivate-keypairs-instead-of-by-password.html) from the Pi to your computer.
